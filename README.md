# Pneumonia Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Overview:
Pneumonia is a significant health concern globally, characterized by lung inflammation, often leading to severe respiratory distress. Timely and accurate diagnosis are essential for effective treatment and management. However, traditional diagnostic methods relying on clinical examination and radiological imaging can be time-consuming and prone to human error. To address this challenge, our project leverages deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to automate pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images.

## Project Goals:
Our primary goal is to develop a robust CNN model capable of accurately identifying pneumonia cases from chest X-ray images. By training on a dataset labeled with "Pneumonia" and "Normal" categories, we aim to create an automated classification system that enhances diagnostic efficiency and accuracy.

## Importance of the Project:
- **Early Detection:** Early detection of pneumonia is crucial for timely medical intervention and improved patient outcomes. Automating the detection process through deep learning can expedite diagnosis, leading to better prognosis for affected individuals.
- **Resource Optimization:** Traditional diagnostic methods often require skilled radiologists, leading to resource-intensive processes, especially in regions with limited healthcare infrastructure. Our automated system optimizes resource allocation by reducing the reliance on manual interpretation.
- **Scalability and Accessibility:** Deep learning models offer scalability and can be deployed in various healthcare settings, including remote or underserved areas. By providing an accessible tool for pneumonia diagnosis, we aim to democratize healthcare access.
- **Reduced Misdiagnosis:** Misdiagnosis of pneumonia can result in delayed treatment and unnecessary healthcare costs. By leveraging CNNs trained on diverse chest X-ray images, we aim to minimize misclassification risks and improve diagnostic accuracy.

## Dataset:
We utilized the Chest X-ray Pneumonia Dataset from Kaggle, comprising chest X-ray images categorized into "Pneumonia" and "Normal" classes. These high-resolution images serve as the foundation for training our CNN model.

## Summary:
Our project aims to revolutionize pneumonia detection by harnessing the power of deep learning. Through the development of an accurate and scalable CNN-based classification system, we strive to improve patient care and public health outcomes worldwide. To demonstrate our project we will be showcasing our Pneumonia Detection CNN model by deploying it on our custom-built website.
